# Learn Hiragana and Katakana

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Japanese and Kana

Welcome to your first Japanese lesson 🎌

Before learning to write and read, it's important to understand **how the Japanese writing system works** and why there are different types of characters.

### 🈶 The Japanese Writing System

Japanese uses **three main writing systems**, which are often used in the same sentence:

{ title: "ひらがな (Hiragana)", description: "Used for Japanese words, particles, and grammatical endings." },
{ title: "カタカナ (Katakana)", description: "Used for foreign words, names, and onomatopoeia." },
{ title: "Kanji (漢字)", description: "Ideograms of Chinese origin that represent concepts or meanings." },

### 📝 What are Kana?

Hiragana and Katakana together are called **Kana (仮名)**.
Each Kana character represents **a syllable (mora)**, not an individual letter as in English.

👉 For example:

- か = _ka_
- す = _su_
- き = _ki_

By combining them, we form words like:

- すし (_sushi_) 🍣
- さくら (_sakura_, cherry blossom) 🌸
- ねこ (_neko_, cat) 🐱

### 🎯 How to learn them

The goal is to **memorize the sounds and strokes** of each character.

Don't worry if they seem difficult at first: with constant practice, you'll recognize them automatically.

Study tips:

- Listen to each syllable and repeat it out loud.
- Practice writing each character several times.
- Associate sounds with words you already know (like _sushi_ or _samurai_).
- Use flashcards or spaced repetition apps (like Anki or Quizlet).

### 🔤 Learning Order

Let's start with **Hiragana**, since it's the most commonly used in texts and will allow you to read from the beginning.
Then we'll move on to **Katakana** (for foreign words) and, later, to the basic **Kanji**.
